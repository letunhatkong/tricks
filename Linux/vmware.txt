<!-- Fix bug đã cài VMware Tools mà bị hư ko chạy được. -->
<!-- Nếu ko có VMware Tools thì ko thể copy, paste cũng như auto scale screen -->
If the bundled VMware Tools is installed, perform the following steps:
Edit the /etc/vmware-tools/vmware-user.desktop file as root by changing this line:
Exec=/usr/bin/vmware-user
To this line:
Exec=env VMWARE_USE_SHIPPED_LIBS=1 /usr/bin/vmware-user
Log out of the guest and log in again.
This change can prevent the VMware Tools service vmtoolsd from failure
To verify that the preceding steps are effective, issue the following command:
'ps -aux | grep vmtools'
The appropriate command return shows both of the following vmtoolsd services running:
-/usr/sbin/vmtoolsd
-/usr/lib/vmware-tools/sbin64/vmtoolsd
